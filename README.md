# Performance-Highlights-from-the-Paralympic-Games-using-Power-BI-Desktop
As part of my Power BI analyst internship, I developed a robust dashboard visualizing performance trends in the Paralympic Games. This project involved extensive data modeling and visualization techniques within Power BI Desktop. I created key performance indicators (KPIs) using DAX to track metrics such as total medals, participating countries, and NPC representation. The dashboard features a range of interactive visuals, including:

*  Stacked column charts: Medal distribution by country and games city.
*  Clustered bar charts: Games participation by country and medal breakdown by season.
*  Scatter plots: Correlation between gold medals and NPC ranking.
*  Geographic visualizations: Maps showing medal distribution and game duration by continent.
*  Funnel charts: Ranking by games country.
*  Matrix visualizations: Detailed medal counts by sport and NPC. Slicers for sports, continent, country, and year enable users to drill down into specific data segments. This project showcases my proficiency in DAX, data visualization best practices, and creating user-friendly, insightful dashboards.

Achievements:
*  Leveraged advanced DAX queries to calculate complex metrics and ensure accurate data manipulation.
*  Crafted visually appealing and interactive dashboards to uncover actionable insights.
*  Delivered a comprehensive performance analysis, empowering decision-makers with data-driven insights.

This project reflects my proficiency in data visualization, storytelling through dashboards, and technical expertise in Power BI. It also showcases my passion for delivering meaningful insights that drive impact.
